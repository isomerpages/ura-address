<h3>The Purpose of House and Unit Numbers</h3>

Properties have to be numbered for identification purposes. The allotted number in combination with the name of the street at which it is located, forms a unique address.

A house address comprises:<br>[House Number] [Street Name] [# Unit Number, if any] Singapore [Postal Code]


<h3>Guidelines for House and Unit Number</h3>
Houses and buildings are numbered for identification purposes. The <b>house number or unit number</b> allotted is guided by the general principles of horizontal numbering and vertical numbering systems.

<h4>1) House Number (Horizontal Numbering)</h4>
This refers to the unique number assigned to a building or development along a road.

<b>a. Odd and Even Numbers</b><br>
The numbering of buildings is in ascending order, with odd numbers on the left side of the road and even numbers on the right side. The direction of the road from which the numbers take reference is pre-determined by the Comptroller.

<b>b. Order and Sequence</b><br>
The numbers will be in sequential order and omission of any numbers is not allowed. For example, the numbers 4, 13, 14, etc., which can be perceived as undesirable or inauspicious, will not be omitted. In situations where there are insufficient numeric numbers, alphabetical suffixes starting from A, B, C, etc. may be assigned to the numbers. The alphabets “I” and “O” are not allowed to avoid confusion.

<b>c. Frontage/ Main Entrance</b><br>
As a general rule, developments will be allotted a house number in sequence to those along the street where the main entrance is located. For developments with vehicular access located on a minor road (due to planning or road requirements), the Comptroller may allot house numbers along the main road if the development has a main entrance along the main road.

<b>d. Reservation of Numbers</b><br>
The Comptroller can reserve numbers for adjoining sites which can potentially be subdivided into smaller plots.

<h4>2) Unit Number (Vertical Numbering)</h4>
This refers to the number assigned to a unit within a building, where applicable. The unit number is preceded by '#' e.g. #12-456. The first two digits refer to the floor level the unit is located on, while the numbers after the hyphen sign refer to the allotted number for the particular unit.

<b>a. Numbering of Floors</b><br>
The numbers '01' is normally assigned to the first level of a building where the main entrance is located, followed by '02' for the second level and so on. Basements are assigned "B1', 'B2' and so on downwards. Omission of any numbers is not allowed.

<b>b. Mezzanine Floors</b><br>
A mezzanine floor with access from internal stairs within a unit on a particular floor will be considered as part of that same floor. A mezzanine floor with an external access will be considered as a separate floor.

<b>c. Unit Numbers</b><br>
Units are generally numbered sequentially in a clock-wise direction starting from "01". A unit number will be provided for each distinct unit shown on the floor plan. Omission and reservation of any numbers is not allowed for a residential development. However, for very large commercial units, unit numbers may be reserved for possible future subdivision. Alphabetical suffixes starting from A, B, C (with the exception of “I” and “O”), etc. will be assigned where necessary.

For developments with multiple blocks, the unit numbers for the respective blocks have to run in sequential order across the blocks and cannot be repeated, e.g., for a development with 2 blocks - 1 Newton Road #01-01 to #01-10, 3 Newton Road #01-11 to #01-20.
