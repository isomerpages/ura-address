<h4>The Purpose of House and Unit Numbers</h4>

Properties have to be numbered for identification purposes. The allotted number in combination with the name of the street at which it is located, forms a unique address.

<h4>Guidelines for House Numbers</h4>

<p>This refers to the unique number assigned to a building or development along a road.  
  
a. Order and Sequence  
The numbering of buildings is in ascending order, with odd numbers on the left side of the road and even numbers on the right side. The numbers will be in sequential order and omission of any numbers is not allowed. In situations where there are insufficient numeric numbers, alphabetical suffixes starting from A, B, C, etc. may be assigned to the numbers. The alphabets “I” and “O” are not allowed to avoid confusion.  
  
b. Frontage/ Main Entrance  
As a general rule, developments will be allotted a house number in sequence along the street where the main entrance is located.</p>

<h4>Guidelines for Unit Numbers</h4>

This refers to the number assigned to a unit within a building, where applicable. The unit number is preceded by '#' e.g. #12-456. The first two digits refer to the floor level the unit is located on, while the numbers after the hyphen sign refer to the allotted number for the particular unit.  
  
a. Numbering of Floors  
The numbers '01' is normally assigned to the first level of a building where the main entrance is located, followed by '02' for the second level and so on. Basements are assigned "B1', 'B2' and so on downwards. Omission of any numbers is not allowed.  
  
b. Numbering of Units  
Units are generally numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction starting from "01". A unit number will be provided for each distinct unit shown on the floor plan. Omission and reservation of any numbers is not allowed for residential developments. However, for very large commercial units, unit numbers may be reserved for possible future subdivision. Alphabetical suffixes starting from A, B, C (with the exception of “I” and “O”), etc. will be assigned where necessary.  
  
c. Mezzanine Floors  
A mezzanine floor with access from internal stairs within a unit on a particular floor will be considered part of that same floor. A mezzanine floor with an external access will be considered as a separate floor.

<h4>Display of House and Unit Numbers</h4>

The property owner is required to display the house/unit number at a conspicuous place. Failure to display the assigned number or displaying an unassigned number is an offence under the Property Tax Act.

2.In the case of a house, building or other property - on the outside surface of the front door or front wall of such house or building or at the entrance of the enclosure of the property in such a position as to be clearly visible from the road in which the property is situated.

3. The numerals or lettering used shall be  
* of a colour that contrasts with the background against which they are displayed;
* large enough to be recognized from 10 metres; and  
* of durable, non-absorbent material.
