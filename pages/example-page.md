The Role of the Street and Building Names Board

The Street and Building Names Board (SBNB) evaluates and approves street, building and estate name applications to ensure that names are appropriate in the context of the location and the physical attributes of the buildings and streets.  
  
The Board comprises representatives from government agencies and the private sector.  
  
Building owners and developers are required to submit naming applications to SBNB to ensure the appropriateness of the proposed names.
