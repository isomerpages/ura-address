    <div>
      <p>The owner or developer is required to inform IRAS on the withdrawal of number when a house/unit number is no longer required. In situations when a building has been demolished, the house number becomes invalid and should therefore be withdrawn. To notify IRAS on the withdrawal of number, email us atÂ housenumber@iras.gov.sg.</p>
