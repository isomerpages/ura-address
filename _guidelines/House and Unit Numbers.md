<h3>Role to Allot and Alter House and Unit Numbers </h3>

The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is given the authority to allot and alter the house and unit number of any property under the Property Tax Act. 

Buildings and units are numbered for identification purposes. It is important that property developers, owners or their appointed representatives apply to IRAS for unique property address to be authorised for use and display every house and unit number at a conspicuous location. The use of an unauthorised number is an offence under the Property Tax Act.

The allotted number in combination with the name of the street where it is located, forms a unique address.

<h3>House and Unit Numbering Guidelines</h3>

House and unit number should provide clear location or direction cues to the public so that they can be easily identified and located by emergency personnel, delivery services and the public in a quick and efficient way. 

A good house/unit number is one that:
* Is appropriate and relates to the street where the main entrance/frontage is located 
* Is sequential to the planning of numbers for the building and street
* Avoids confusion with another building or unit in another part of Singapore

We encourage applicants to read through the house and unit number guidelines in the handbook below. It explains the importance of house and unit number, and the considerations by IRAS when approving house and/or unit number applications.
