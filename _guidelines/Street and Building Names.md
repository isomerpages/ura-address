<h3>The Role of the Street and Building Names Board</h3>

<p align="justify">The Street and Building Names Board (SBNB) evaluates and approves street, building and estate name applications to ensure that names are appropriate in the context of the location and the physical attributes of the buildings and streets.  

The Board comprises representatives from government agencies and the private sector.  

Building owners and developers are required to submit naming applications to SBNB to ensure the appropriateness of the proposed names.</p>

<h3>Street and Building Naming Guidelines</h3>

<p align="justify">Street and building names should provide clear location or direction cues to the public so that they can locate properties and essential services quickly and efficiently.</p>

A good name is one that:  

* Is appropriate and relates to the location and environment of the buildings and streets  
* Fits the physical attributes of the buildings and streets  
* Avoids confusion with another development or street in another part of Singapore  
* Retains the history of the building or the area  
* Is unique, reasonably short and easy to pronounce, spell and remember  

<p align="justify">We encourage applicants to read through the naming principles and guidelines in the Handbooks below.</p>
