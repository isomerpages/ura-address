2. Designed based on industry feedback, the new e-service includes features such as:
a.     an improved interface for easier viewing and managing of multiple applications,

b.     an interactive map for easy selection of the property,

c.     auto-retrieval of applicant’s particulars via MyInfo, and

d.     automated checks to help applicants comply with IRAS and SBNB guidelines.

3. All new applications for both house and unit numbers and street and building names can now be submitted through the new e-service. The e-service can be accessed at [https://digitalservice.propertynaa.gov.sg](https://digitalservice.propertynaa.gov.sg "https://digitalservice.propertynaa.gov.sg/"). For ease of transition, IRAS will continue to accept manual applications for house and unit number until 30 Jun 2023.
