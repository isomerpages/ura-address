<i>Date: 26 April 2023</i>

<p align="justify">The Street and Building Names Board (SBNB) and Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) are pleased to announce the launch of the <b>Property Name and Address</b>  e-service. This new e-service aims to provide greater convenience for users to apply for street and building names and house and unit numbers on the same platform.</p>
Designed based on industry feedback, the new e-service includes features such as:

a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an improved interface for easier viewing and managing of multiple applications,

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an interactive map for easy selection of the property,

c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; auto-retrieval of applicant’s particulars via MyInfo, and

d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; automated checks to help applicants comply with IRAS and SBNB guidelines.<br>

<p align="justify">All new applications for both street and building names and house and unit numbers can now be submitted through the new e-service. The e-service can be accessed at <a href="https://digitalservice.propertynaa.gov.sg">https://digitalservice.propertynaa.gov.sg</a>. For ease of transition, IRAS will continue to accept manual applications for house and unit number until 30 Jun 2023.</p>

<p align="justify">Other than the e-service, a new informational website at <a href="https://propertynaa.gov.sg">https://propertynaa.gov.sg</a> will consolidate guidelines and FAQs for applications regarding both street and building names and house and unit numbers.</p>
