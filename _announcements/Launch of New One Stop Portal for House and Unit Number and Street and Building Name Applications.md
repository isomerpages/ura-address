1. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) and Street and Building Names Board (SBNB) are pleased to announce the launch of the **Property Name and Address**  e-service. This new e-service aims to provide greater convenience for users to apply for house and unit numbers and street and building names on the same platform.<br>
<br>
3. Designed based on industry feedback, the new e-service includes features such as:

a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an improved interface for easier viewing and managing of multiple applications,

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an interactive map for easy selection of the property,

c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; auto-retrieval of applicantâ€™s particulars via MyInfo, and

d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; automated checks to help applicants comply with IRAS and SBNB guidelines.<br>
<br>

3. All new applications for both house and unit numbers and street and building names can now be submitted through the new e-service. The e-service can be accessed at&nbsp;[https://digitalservice.propertynaa.gov.sg](https://digitalservice.propertynaa.gov.sg "https://digitalservice.propertynaa.gov.sg/"). For ease of transition, IRAS will continue to accept manual applications for house and unit number until 30 Jun 2023.<br>
<br>
4. Other than the e-service, a new informational website at https://propertynaa.gov.sg will consolidate guidelines and FAQs for applications regarding both house and unit numbers and street and/or building names.<br>
