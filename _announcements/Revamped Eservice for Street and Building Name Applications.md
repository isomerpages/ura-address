[Superceded by "Launch of New One Stop Portal for House and Unit Number and Street and Building Name Applications" announcement dated 26 Apr 2023]

1.  The Street and Building Names Board (SBNB) is pleased to launch the revamped SBNB e-service. The new e-service aims to improve applicants’ experience by making it easier to make the application online.<br>        

2.  New features for the e-service include:

* Improved interface for easier viewing and managing of multiple applications  
* Interactive map to easily select the street or building to be named  
* Auto-prompter to instantaneously advise on relevant guidelines based on the proposed name(s)
* Auto-retrieval of applicant’s particulars via MyInfo


3.  The revamped e-service can be accessed via this [link](https://digitalservice.ura.gov.sg/sbnb/). It is also accessible on-the-go from your tablets and mobile devices.<br>
<br>
4.  We are also collaborating with IRAS to integrate house and unit number applications to create a one-stop portal for street and building naming and address applications. More information on this will be released at a later date.&nbsp;<br>
